/** Create class Point3D to represent a point in 3-D space with coordinates x, y and z.
 *  Define properties for each field and following methods: distanceTo() - for calculating 
 *  the distance to another point; toString(), which returns a string similar 
 *  to â€œ(2,-7,0)"; moveTo(Point3D point), which should change the coordinates of point 
 *  to the given; Create a class PointsSet which consists of field "points" 
 *  (container of Point3D objects). In this class define method addPoint() for adding 
 *  point to container; method toString() for converting  points to user friendly string;
 *  method distance(), which calculates the sum of distances between all points 
 *  (from first to the last); method move(), which should move all points from container, 
 *  which are inside the ball of radius 5 and center in origin, to the first point 
 *  in container. Write short code to demonstrate your solution. Your code should 
 *  include class (interface) aggregation or inheritance, should use collections or 
 *  generics, should implement exception handling.
